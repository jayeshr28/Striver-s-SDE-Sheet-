Implement pow(x, n), which calculates x raised to the power n (i.e., xn).

 

Example 1:

Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
Output: 1024.00000
Example 2:

Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3
Output: 9.26100
Example 3:

Input: x = 2.00000, n = -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2-2 = 1/22 = 1/4 = 0.25

//recursive solution
if(n==0) return 1;
        
        if(n<0){
            n = abs(n);
            x = 1/x;
        }
        
        if(n%2 == 0) return myPow(x*x,n/2);
        else return x*myPow(x,n-1);


//optimal
double myPow(double x, int n) {
  double ans = 1.0;
  long long nn = n;
  if (nn < 0) nn = -1 * nn;
  while (nn) {
    if (nn % 2) {
      ans = ans * x;
      nn = nn - 1;
    } else {
      x = x * x;
      nn = nn / 2;
    }
  }
  if (n < 0) ans = (double)(1.0) / (double)(ans);
  return ans;
}

Time Complexity: O(log n)

Space Complexity: O(1)

Approach: Initialize ans as 1.0  and store a duplicate copy of n i.e nn using to avoid overflow

Check if nn is a negative number, in that case, make it a positive number.

Keep on iterating until nn is greater than zero, now if nn is an odd power then multiply x with ans ans reduce nn by 1. Else multiply x with itself and divide nn by two.

Now after the entire binary exponentiation is complete and nn becomes zero, check if n is a negative value we know the answer will be 1 by and.
