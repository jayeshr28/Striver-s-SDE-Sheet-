Given 3 positives numbers a, b and c. Return the minimum flips required in some bits of a and b to make ( a OR b == c ). (bitwise OR operation).
Flip operation consists of change any single bit 1 to 0 or change the bit 0 to 1 in their binary representation.

 

Example 1:



Input: a = 2, b = 6, c = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: After flips a = 1 , b = 4 , c = 5 such that (a OR b == c)
Example 2:

Input: a = 4, b = 2, c = 7
Output: 1
Example 3:

Input: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3
Output: 0

//SOLUTION

Step 1: a | b is what we have while c is what we want. An XOR operation finds all different bits, i.e. (a | b) ^ c sets the bits where flip(s) is needed. Then we count the set bits.
Step 2: There is only one case when two flips are needed: a bit is 0 in c but is 1 in both a and b. An AND operation finds all common 1 bits, i.e. a & b & ((a | b) ^ c) sets the common 1 bits in a, b and the must-flip bits found in Step 1.

int minFlips(int a, int b, int c) {
    return popcount((a | b) ^ c) + popcount(a & b & ((a | b) ^ c));
}
or simplify with an assignment:

int minFlips(int a, int b, int c) {
    return popcount(c ^= a | b) + popcount(a & b & c);
}
Note: The popcount function is a C++ 20 standard builtin function that counts set bits. LeetCode uses g++ compiler with the C++17 standard so we can use __builtin_popcount instead. For other compilers please use bitset<32>().count().
